Radioactive-Evolution
=====================

Premise The local nuclear power plant has been disposing of its waste in a nearby lake. The plankton in that lake is becoming radioactive. As the player you control a fish, avoiding larger predators and eating plankton. The radioactivity of the plankton accelerates your evolution; you choose how to spend your hard-earned XP and how you should evolve next. Do you improve your predator avoidance through purchasing the camouflage ability, or concentrate on growing so that you can eat fish smaller than you, or become poisonous and take down the mightiest fish? The choice is up to you! Architectural Description The game is written in object-oriented JavaScript and HTML5 and is designed to be modular and self-contained. Indeed, game.html requires just a canvas and a single script call. The intention was always to release this software to the public domain as open source software, so I've programmed with maintainability in mind, making use of object-orientation, factory methods and inheritence.
