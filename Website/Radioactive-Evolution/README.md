@TODO

Bug / TODO list so far:

    Still need to get Poison working again

    Need to fix "All upgrades purchased" achievement

    Need to re-add Mousetrap to support keyboard control (or at least cheats)

    When fish swims into user, death message appears but death menu doesn't paint until mouse is moved.

    On first load, image background etc don't render.

    Need to remove capital letters from filenames.

    Only the last button in a menu has a cursor: pointer; hover state. The rest don't.
